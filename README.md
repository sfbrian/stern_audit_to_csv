# Stern Pinball Audit Dump to CSV Conversion Script
This converts Stern Pinball's audit dump text files into a csv so you can visualize the data in a spreadsheet.

I've tested this with Metallica audit dumps. Please let me know if this works or doesn't work with other machines.

Usage:

```python stern_audit_to_csv.py -f <inputfile>```
